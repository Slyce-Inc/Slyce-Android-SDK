## Use Cases

The SDK enables 3 major modes of operation: **Headless**, **Headless/Camera**, **Full UI**.

### Headless

SDK provides the methods required to submit images and receive results. 
Ideal for cases where the app already handles the camera and has its own UI.

### Headless/Camera

A headless mode where the SDK manages the camera. **App developers are responsible to implement their own UI.** 
Ideal for cases where app developers would like to utilize SDK features such as continues barcodes detection, yet would like to maintain full flexibility with anything related to the UI/UX.

### Full UI

The SDK takes care of the entire flow from scanning to getting results. The SDK provides a UI that can be customized. Provides a turnkey scan-to-products solution.
